# What-are-the-key-achievements-of-Dr.-Nitin-Singhal-in-surgical-oncology-

Dr. Nitin Singhal has done a lot in the field of surgical oncology. One of his biggest achievements is his success in combining modern surgical techniques like robotic cancer surgery and HIPEC (heated chemotherapy) with traditional cancer treatments. This mix gives patients better outcomes and faster recovery.

Heâ€™s performed hundreds of complex cancer surgeries across different types like gastrointestinal, gynecologic, urologic, and even pediatric cases. His patients have included both early-stage and late-stage cancer cases. Some of these surgeries were robotic-assisted, allowing patients to return home much sooner than expected.

He was trained at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, which is one of the top cancer centers in Asia. Thatâ€™s already a huge achievement, as only top students get accepted there. After that, he started his practice in Ahmedabad and built a center where patients get modern cancer care with a personal touch.

Dr. Singhal is also known for:

Introducing robotic cancer surgery to more patients in Gujarat

Treating international patients with top-quality results

Speaking at national conferences and contributing to cancer research

Helping families understand cancer treatment clearly, in easy language

His calm nature and deep knowledge make him a favorite among patients and their families. Many people say they feel like theyâ€™re in safe hands the moment they speak to him.
